# Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning Models

## Usage

This is my implementation of some shallow deep models (Dense, LSTM, TCN and Transformer Neural Networks) that should deal with our data.

To run with your options you just have to **modify the config file (`config/config.yaml`)** and run `train.py`.
It automatically create some folders for the experiment where it:
* saves the best checkpoint in `ck.pt` file
* saves the config for further reuse of the same option scheme
* generates a folder "logs" where it stores:
    * the train losses (`train.txt`)
    * the evaluation metrics (`test.txt`)
    * the best checkpoint (epoch and loss) (`ckpt.txt`)
    * the best checkpoint metrics (`metrics.txt`)
* generates a folder `viz` where it stores the comparisons Predicted vs. GT on test set like the following ![example](images/test_predictions_3.png)
* fill a table `checkpoint/results.xlsx` with the name of the model used, some config parameters, and its performance. It will use xlsx sheets to separate results on each store
* first, third, forth and fifth bullets are computed for each store (in an appropriate folder)

The folder structure it will create is depicted below:

## Environment

You'll just need the following packages in your environment:

- pandas
- numpy
- yaml
- argparse
- datetime
- torch
- matplotlib
- openpyxl

At the present moment it just run on CPU, but it doesn't take much time to run (6/7 minutes on 1000 epochs for LSTM and Dense model on a single store).
